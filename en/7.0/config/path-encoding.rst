About the encoding of the path changes
======================================

in non-HTML file, different character set precedents and the file name
if the search result link text is garbled.

For example, test.txt file contents are written in UTF-8, file name
Shift\_JIS, the link text is garbled.

How to set up
=============

For example by revising the
webapps/fess/WEB-INF/classes/s2robot\_transformer.dicon as shown below,
to resolve paths in Shift\_JIS.

::

    <component name="fessFileTransformer" class="jp.sf.fess.transformer. |Fess| FileTransformer" instance="singleton">
       <property name="name">"fessFileTransformer"</property>
       <property name="ignoreEmptyContent">true</property>
       <property name="encoding">"Shift_JIS"</property>
    </component>
