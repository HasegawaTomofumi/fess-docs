Overview
========

Summarizes the information needed to develop the Fess.

Knowledge required
==================

Fess is developed as an application to work in the environment of the
Java 7 or more. The following knowledge becomes necessary.

-  Java

-  Seasar 2

-  SAStruts (if you are developing a Web screen)

-  DBFlute (if you are developing around the DB)

-  SOLR (if you are developing around the search index)

-  S2Robot (if you are developing around the crawler)

When you develop using Eclipse and Maven in this scenario (to build to
generate in the fess-server release of Ant becomes necessary). Also to
develop and operate Fess server for download and you have installed.
Dude install in advance is what you need.

On the development of the screen around the Web
===============================================

Summarizes how to develop management and search screens. Describes how
to develop with Eclipse. You must keep your development on the Eclipse
WTP, etc (you installed the J2EE Edition).

1. Install Java, Eclipse, Maven 3.x, Fess and prepare. A zip file of the
   Fess <FESS\_HOME>suppose you deploy directory. </FESS\_HOME>

2. The source code of the Fess clone from github.

   ::

       git clone https://github.com/codelibs/fess.git

3. As a Maven project into the Eclipse.

4. Display the servers view. If you don't see the Window > Show View >
   Other... In, display the dialog Server > Servers, select OK button
   press concludes.

5. Add a new server in the servers view. Tomcat v7.0 Server, select the
   server name is set to moderate, the Next button press concludes. The
   Add Configured: fess Finish button press concludes. So that server in
   the servers view is displayed, double click the display settings
   information (Overview).

6. Select Use Tomcat Installation Server Locations.

7. In the timeouts Start to 180 seconds, change the Stop to 60 seconds.

8. Click the General Information Open Launch Configuration. Click the
   tag arguments. In the VM arguments
   '-Dsolr.solr.home=<FESS\_HOME>/solr-Dfess.log.file=<FESS\_HOME>/logs/fess.out-Dsolr.log.file=<FESS\_HOME>/logs/solr.log-Djava.awt.headless=true---Xmx1g-XX:

   OptimizeStringConcat ' add the. <FESS\_HOME>Will change depending on
   the environment. OK button press concludes. (If the Java
   7-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize = 128 m-XX:CompressedClassSpaceSize = 32
   m-XX:MaxPermSize = 128 m to replace)</FESS\_HOME> </FESS\_HOME>
   </FESS\_HOME> </FESS\_HOME>

9. Boot the server from the servers view.

If you want to develop a HOT deploy src/main/resources/env.txt change
from the product the ct. You can change the source code, without having
to restart the Tomcat (Fess).

On the development of crawl around
==================================

The crawl process Tomcat (Fess) starts a process. If you want to pursue
in the debugger, such as to register as for debugging Java applications
on Eclipse.

1. Register as a normal Java Application can be debugged in Eclipse.
   main function will be to jp.sf.fess.exec.Crawler.

2. In settings 1, argument settings, first, passes a session
   ID-sessionId 20100101000000 to appropriate program settings. Expand
   the contents of the Fess bin/setenv.sh to the VM Settings and
   register.

3. Add /fess/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cmd and
   geronimo\_servlet\_9.4\_spec-1.0.jar in the classpath setting.

4. The run.

About creating a distribution of Fess
=====================================

Distribution of Fess is included in Tomcat war file of the Fess and
Solr. Build the distribution of Fess in SVN fess-server. In order to
build Ant becomes necessary.

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/codelibs/fess-server.git
    $ cd fess-server
    $ ant clean
    $ ant
