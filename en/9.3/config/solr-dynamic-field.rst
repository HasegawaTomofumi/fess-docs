=====================

SOLR is document items (fields) for each to the schema defined in order
to register. Available in Fess Solr schema is defined in
solr/core1/conf/schema.xml. dynamic fields and standard fields such as
title and content can be freely defined field names are defined.
Advanced parameter values see a Solr document.

How to use the
==============

I think scenes using the dynamic field of many, in database scrawl's,
such as registering in datastore crawl settings. How to register dynamic
fields in database scrawl by placing the script other\_t = hoge hoge
column data into Solr other\_t field.

You need to add a field to use to retrieve data that is stored in the
dynamic field next to the webapps/fess/WEB-INF/classes/app.dicon. Add
the other\_t.

::

        <component name="queryHelper" class="jp.sf.fess.helper.impl.QueryHelperImpl">
            <property name="searchFields">new String[]{"url", "host", "site",
                "title", "content", "contentLength", "lastModified", "mimetype",
                "label", "segment", "other_t" }</property>
        </component>

You must add a field to use to retrieve data that is stored in the
dynamic field from Solr. Add the other\_t.

::

        <component name="queryHelper" class="jp.sf.fess.helper.impl.QueryHelperImpl">
           <property name="responseFields">new String[]{"id", "score", "boost",
                "contentLength", "host", "site", "lastModified", "mimetype",
                "tstamp", "title", "digest", "url", "other_t" }</property>
        </component>

Edit the JSP file has made returns from Solr in the above settings, so
to display on the page. Login to the manage screen, displays the design.
Display of search results the search results displayed on the page (the
content), so edit the JSP file. where you want to display the other\_t
value in $ {f:h(doc.other\_t)} and you can display the value registered
in.
