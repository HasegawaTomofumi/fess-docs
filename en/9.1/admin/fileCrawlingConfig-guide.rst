folder crawl settings for smb: (last / to) the //host1/share/. If
authentication is in the shared folder on the file system authentication
screen set authentication information.

| Path to crawl                            | Crawl the path for the specified regular expression.                                                                                                                        |
+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The path to exclude from being crawled   | The path for the specified regular expression does not crawl. The path you want to crawl, even WINS here.                                                                   |

+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Path to exclude from searches            | Not search the path for the specified regular expression. Unable to search all links since they exclude from being crawled and crawled when the search and not just some.   |
