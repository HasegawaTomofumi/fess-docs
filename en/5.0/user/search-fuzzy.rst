Fuzzy search (fuzzy search)
===========================

Fess is corresponding to fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein
distance (fuzzy search). After the search word you want to apply the
fuzzy search adds '~'. For example, see Solr ~ ' that you can search for
documents that contain the search string "Solr" similar to the language
or ("Solar").

Furthermore, you can specify a number between 0 and 1 ~ after the close
to 1 just like in refine. For example, in the form of 'Solr~0.8'. Do not
specify numeric default value is 0.5.
